## D-statistics
Contains results pertaining to D-statistics estimated from genome-wide SNP data for cichlids from Barombi Mbo using Dsuite. "Observed" contains the estimated statistics from the empirical dataset, and "Simulated contained the D-statistics estimated from simulated data under the coalescent (according to a model without admixture fitted using momi2).

Observed statistics were calculated for all trios for which we simulated SNP data for - the coalescent model fitted in momi2 did not include all sequences species due to computational limitations.
